# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python (Google Colab)

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using Python and visualization libraries in Google Colab. The analysis includes case trends, recovery and death rates, and region-wise statistics.

## 📊 Key Highlights
- Dataset includes country-wise and region-wise statistics: confirmed, recovered, deaths, and new cases.
- Uses Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- Interactive visualizations such as:
  - Choropleth map of global confirmed cases
  - Pie chart of top 10 countries by confirmed cases
  - Bar charts showing new cases by WHO region and top 10 countries
    
  ## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Google Colab** (Python 3)
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for statistical plots
- **Plotly Express & Graph Objects** for interactive dashboards

## 📌 How to Use
1. Open the `covid_analysis.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the dataset (CSV or Excel) if prompted.
3. Run the notebook cells to explore analysis and visualizations.
